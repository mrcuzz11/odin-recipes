# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, aimed at building foundational HTML and Git skills.

In this project, I'll create a simple recipe website that contains:
- A main index page linking to multiple recipe pages.
- Individual pages for each recipe with details about ingredients and instructions.

## Goals and Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have practiced:
1. **HTML Basics:** Structuring a website using proper tags like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
2. **Git and GitHub:** Initializing a repository, staging and committing changes, pushing to a remote repository, and using branches (optional).
3. **File Organization:** Maintaining a clear and logical directory structure.
4. **Self-reflection:** Reviewing progress and documenting key learning milestones.

Stay tuned for delicious recipes and a growing set of skills!
